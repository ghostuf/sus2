 An array containing 5 elements is stored from memory location 4000h to 4000h; write an assembly language program for 8085 microprocessor to find largest element of array and store in memory location 4005h.

 Assembly Language Program

ORG 0000h ; Origin of the program

; Initialize HL to point to the start of the array (4000h)
LXI H, 4000h

; Initialize the largest element with 00 (assuming values are positive)
MVI A, 00
MOV B, A ; Initialize B register to store the largest element

; Loop through the array to find the largest element
LOOP:
LHLD ; Load 16-bit data from memory into HL
MOV C, L ; Copy the lower byte (element) to register C
MOV D, H ; Copy the higher byte (element) to register D

; Compare the current element with the largest element
CMP B
JNC NOT_LARGER ; If not larger, skip the update

; Update the largest element
MOV B, A

NOT_LARGER:
INX H ; Move to the next element in the array
DCR C ; Decrement the loop counter (assuming elements are 8-bit)
JNZ LOOP ; Continue looping until all elements are checked

; Store the largest element in memory location 4005h
STAX D ; Store A register (largest element) at the address in DE pair
HLT ; Halt the program

; Data section (assuming the array is stored from 4000h to 4004h)
DB 10, 25, 15, 30, 5

END ; End of the program
