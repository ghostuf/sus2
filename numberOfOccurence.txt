Write an assembly language program for 16 bit microprocessor to count and display number of occurrence of letter ‘o’ in string “Microprocessor organization”


ORG 1000h ; Set the origin address

MOV CX, 0 ; Initialize CX register to count occurrences
MOV SI, 0 ; Initialize SI register as a pointer to the string

MOV AL, ‘o’ ; Load AL with the character to search for
MOV BX, 0 ; Initialize BX register for counting

SEARCH_LOOP:
MOV AH, [SI] ; Load the next character from the string into AH
CMP AH, 0 ; Check if it’s the null terminator (end of the string)
JE END_SEARCH ; If it is, exit the loop

CMP AH, AL ; Compare the character in AH with ‘o’
JNE NOT_FOUND ; If not equal, continue searching

INC BX ; Increment the count in BX if ‘o’ is found

NOT_FOUND:
INC SI ; Move to the next character in the string
JMP SEARCH_LOOP

END_SEARCH:
; Display the count in BX (number of ‘o’ occurrences)
MOV DL, BL ; Load DL with the count (convert to ASCII)
ADD DL, ‘0’ ; Convert the count to ASCII

; Display the result on the screen (you may need to adjust this part)
MOV AH, 2 ; Function code for displaying a character
MOV AH, DL ; Character to display
INT 21h ; Call DOS interrupt for displaying

HLT ; Halt the program

; Data section
DB “Microprocessor organization”, 0 ; Null-terminated string

ORG 0100h ; Start of program memory address (adjust as needed)
